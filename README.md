## Drawing Guidelines
- Wire nodes are conveniently grid-aligned in Inkscape.
- Wires have a width of 0.7 px.
- Wire corners and ends are sharp, not rounded.
- The fonts Times New Roman (6 pt) and Linux Libertine (6 pt) are recommended for annotations.
- Component reference designators are italicized, and (symbols of) physical quantities use the regular font style.
